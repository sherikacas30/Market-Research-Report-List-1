<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PI Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PI fibers, or polyimide fibers, are categorized into two main market types based on their production processes: wet spinning and dry spinning. Wet spinning involves dissolving polyimide polymers in a solvent, then extruding the solution through a spinneret into a coagulating bath, allowing the fibers to solidify. In contrast, dry spinning entails vaporizing a solvent from a polymer solution, producing fibers in a drier environment. Both methods play vital roles in producing high-performance fibers for diverse applications, including aerospace and electronics.</p></p>
