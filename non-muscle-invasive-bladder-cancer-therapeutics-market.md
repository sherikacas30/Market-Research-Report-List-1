<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravesical Chemotherapy</li><li>Intravesical Immunotherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Therapeutics market primarily includes two types: intravesical chemotherapy and intravesical immunotherapy. Intravesical chemotherapy involves directly administering chemotherapeutic agents into the bladder to target cancer cells while minimizing systemic exposure. In contrast, intravesical immunotherapy aims to stimulate the patient's immune system to fight cancer by introducing agents like bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) into the bladder. Both approaches are designed to prevent recurrence and progression of bladder cancer, offering targeted treatment options.</p></p>
