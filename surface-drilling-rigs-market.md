<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Drilling Rigs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Top-Hammer</li><li>Down-the-Hole</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surface drilling rigs are primarily categorized into two main types: top-hammer and down-the-hole (DTH) rigs. Top-hammer rigs use a percussive drilling mechanism where the drill bit is driven by a hammer located on the drill string. They are versatile and often used in both mining and construction. Conversely, DTH rigs feature a hammer located directly above the drill bit, providing greater penetration and efficiency in hard rock formations. Both types are essential for various surface drilling applications, each having distinct advantages.</p></p>
