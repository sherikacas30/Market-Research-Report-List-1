<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lifting Thread Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resorbable</li><li>Permanent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lifting thread devices are classified into two main types: resorbable and permanent. Resorbable lifting threads break down over time in the body, providing temporary support and gradually stimulating collagen production as they dissolve. This type is often favored for its minimal long-term impact. In contrast, permanent lifting threads provide sustained support and structure, remaining in the body indefinitely. Both types are utilized in aesthetic and reconstructive procedures, catering to varying patient needs and desired outcomes.</p></p>
