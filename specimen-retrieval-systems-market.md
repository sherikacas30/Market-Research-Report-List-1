<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specimen Retrieval Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detachable</li><li>Non-detachable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Specimen retrieval systems are classified into detachable and non-detachable types based on their design and function. Detachable systems feature instruments that can be separated from their retrieval devices after capturing specimens, allowing for easier handling and transport. Non-detachable systems, on the other hand, maintain a continuous connection between the retrieval tool and the specimen, facilitating real-time manipulation but potentially complicating removal. Both types cater to varying surgical needs, influencing their adoption in medical procedures.</p></p>
