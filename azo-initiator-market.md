<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Azo-initiator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil solubility</li><li>Water solubility</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The azo-initiator market is categorized into two main types based on solubility: oil-soluble and water-soluble initiators. Oil-soluble azo-initiators are typically used in non-aqueous systems, such as solvents, where they effectively promote polymerization in applications like coatings and adhesives. In contrast, water-soluble azo-initiators are designed for aqueous environments, making them suitable for emulsions and water-based systems. The choice between these types largely depends on the desired application conditions and the compatibility with the respective mediums.</p></p>
